# Gitignore matcher caching

File discovery shares a compiled matcher between directories with the same
chain of contributing `.gitignore` files. A directory without additional rules
does not retain another compiled copy of every ancestor rule. Nested rules,
negation, directory-only patterns, and `.git/info/exclude` keep their existing
precedence; ignore files below an ignored ancestor are not consulted.

Transient compiled matchers are discarded before the next ignore query after
the matcher-evaluation window (`MATCHER_CACHE_RESET_INTERVAL` in
`packages/core/src/utils/gitIgnoreParser.ts`, currently 10,000 evaluations) has
accumulated. The counter includes both final path checks and ancestor-pruning
checks performed while building a matcher on a cache miss, so deep paths consume
multiple units instead of bypassing the bound. One query can cross the threshold;
the rollover happens before the following query. This also releases the matchers'
internal per-path result caches.

Per-directory rule sets are read the first time the parser probes that directory
and are retained for the parser's lifetime. An edit to an already-probed
`.gitignore` never applies to that parser, while a `.gitignore` in a directory the
parser has not reached yet is read when it is first visited. `.git/info/exclude`
is read at most once per parser instance. A process can hold more than one parser,
so a parser created after an ignore-file edit can observe the new rules while an
existing parser keeps its previously probed directory rules. The interval is an
internal memory/performance tradeoff, not a user setting or a reload mechanism.
Restart the session for a predictable, uniform rule set.

This limits retention caused by repeatedly compiling the same rules, not all
memory used by a search. A sparse glob can still visit a large directory tree,
and per-directory rule lookup memos still scale with directories visited.
Retained compiled matchers scale with contributing ignore-file chains: each
chain-prefix matcher replays the rules from the ignore files above it, so a long
nested chain costs more than one compiled rule set per contributing file. This is
mostly relevant to unusually deep ignore hierarchies; shallow shared chains are
the common case this cache optimizes. For generated outputs that should not be
searched, add their directory to
[`.qwenignore`](../../users/configuration/qwen-ignore.md) so traversal skips the
subtree. The existing Glob result limit is unchanged.

The deterministic core cache-retention suite pins matcher sharing, rollover,
and stable rule snapshots. A real bundled-CLI integration test separately pins
nested ignore and `.qwenignore` semantics through a sparse traversal that spans
more than one matcher-evaluation window (`MATCHER_CACHE_RESET_INTERVAL`); it is
not the discriminator for the memory-retention fix itself.
